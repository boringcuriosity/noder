  Shopping online may be convenient, but not being able to see a product in
  person has its limitations. When looking through products on an ecommerce
  site, people want all of the details they can get. Photos are valuable, but
  they don’t always capture a true representation. This is where augmented
  reality comes in.


  [Scapic](https://scapic.com/)puts the power of augmented reality into your own online store — no coding required. People browsing through your products get a 360-degree view of what you’re offering. This gives them a much better representation of your products.


  Having this flashy AR feature on your startup’s website may be what differentiates you from the competition. Scapic makes it easy to add this attention-grabbing tech into your own design.
