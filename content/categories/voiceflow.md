  As recently as a few years ago, it was hard to imagine how far voice-activated
  technology would come. Siri and Alexa were once strangers, but now they're our
  best friends, giving us the information we're after and fielding our weird
  questions when we're bored (we've all asked Siri if she could pass the Turing
  test — or is it just me?).


  Voice apps shouldn’t just be limited to people who know how to program.[Voiceflow](https://www.voiceflow.com/)makes voice app development for Alexa tools and Google actions possible for everyone without entering even a single line of code.


  Creating a voice app involves arranging drag-and-drop blocks, which builds the logic and structure for rapid application development. It’s a simple visual interface that removes all of the complexity.


  If you’re an aspiring app creator who has always wanted to build something for Google or Alexa, Voiceflow’s no code application development platform lets you do just that.
